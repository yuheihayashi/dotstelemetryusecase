Thanks. I addressed this comment.It was just a mistake.

[Yuhei]
Thanks. 

According to the wiki, Supervised Machine Learnig is defined as below.
>>Supervised learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning

It seems that "label" is general term in the ML industry.

Thanks. I addressed this comment.

Now we use <ul></ul> for enumuration to avoid messed up in the xml.

Thanks. I addressed this comment.

As you say, 1 Tps example seems low in 5 years. According to recent report, 2.5 Tbps attack were observed.
https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/global-ddos-attack-trends/

So we rewrited it as below:

OLD:
For example, recent reported large DDoS attacks exceeded 1 Tps.

NEW:
For example, recent reported large DDoS attacks exceeded several Tbps.

[Yuhei]
Thanks. I addressed this comment.

Genart review gave us same comment, so we modified as below.

OLD:
Then, they can select the DMS to be used to mitigate a DDoS attack under attack time.


NEW:
Then, they can select the DMS to be used to mitigate a DDoS attack at the time of an attack.

[Yuhei]
It's because thatthere are two targets in the example and this usecase enables the transit provider to select DMS for traffic destined for each target.

We modified the figure to clalify it.

[Yuhei]
Thanks. I addressed this comment.

NEW:
To carry out the DNS water torture attack,
an attacker commands a botnet to make thousands of DNS requests
for fake subdomains against an Authoritative Name Server.
