OLD:
The feature of the attack is that start from zero and go to maximum values in a very short time span, then go back to zero, and back to maximum, repeating in continuous cycles at short intervals.

NEW:
These attacks start from zero and go to maximum values in a very short time span, then go back to zero, and then back t maximum, repeating in continuous cycles at short intervals.

Thanks. I addressed this comment, considering Genart and Artart last call review comments.

OLD:
It is difficult for them to mitigate an attack by DMS by redirecting attack flows because it may cause route flapping in the network.

NEW:
It is difficult for the transit providers to mitigate such an attack with their DMSes using a redirecting attack flows because this may cause route flapping in the network.

We calrifed the meaning of "them".

OLD:
After that, the orchestrator integrates the reports from the DDoS mitigation system, while removing duplicate contents, and sends them to a network administrator by using DOTS telemetry periodically.

We assume that multiple flow colletcotrs are allowed as shown in Fig. 16.

OLD:
The forwarding nodes carry out mirroring traffic destined IP address.

NEW:
The forwarding nodes carry out traffic mirroring to copy the traffic destined a IP address and to monitor the traffic by a DMS.
