We added the reference.

We addressed the comment.
We now use 2001:db8:1::/48 and 2001:db8:2::/48 as example of top-talker istead of 2001:db8::2/128 and 2001:db8::3/128

We deleted "E.g.," in all figures to increase readability.

DNS torture attack is given as an example of attack which should be inspected the Layer 7 information.
In this use case, DOTS signal does not convey the DNS tourture attack information. 

We modified the sentence as below because it's a little confusing.

OLD:
Some volumetric attacks, such as amplification attacks,

NEW:
Some volumetric attacks, such as DNS amplification attacks,

[Yuhei]
We aggregated 2001:db8::2/128 and 2001:db8::3/128 to 2001:db8::2/127 in Fig.17
