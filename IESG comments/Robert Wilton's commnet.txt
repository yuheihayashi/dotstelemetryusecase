This document also presents what components are deployed in the network, how they cooperate, and what information is exchanged to effectively use attack-mitigation techniques.

> (2) p 5, sec 3.1.1.  Mitigating Attack Flow of Top-talker Preferentially
>
>    The forwarding nodes send traffic statistics to the flow collectors,
>    e.g., using IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) [RFC7011].  When DDoS
>    attacks occur, the flow collectors identify the attack traffic and
>    send information about the top-talkers to the orchestrator using the
>    "target-prefix" and "top-talkers" DOTS telemetry attributes.  The
>    orchestrator then checks the available capacity of the DMSes by using
>    a network management protocol, such as Simple Network Management
>    Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3413] or YANG with Network Configuration Protocol
>    (YANG/NETCONF) [RFC6020].
>
> Please use RFC 7950 as the reference for YANG.  Please check other references.
