>Section 3.1.1, page 6: If the point is that some DMSes have limited capacity, then shouldn't directing "as much of the >top-talker's traffic to the DMS as possible" by "directing as much of the top-talker's traffic to each DMS as that DMS >can handle" or the like?

We addressed the comment.

OLD:
After that, the orchestrator orders the forwarding nodes to redirect as much of the top-talker's traffic to the DMS as possible by dissemination of Flow Specifications using tools such as Border Gateway Protocol Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules (BGP Flowspec) [RFC8955].

>Why is only SNMP mentioned in this document and not YANG?
[Yuhei]
We addressed the comment.

Of course, YANG/NETCONF can be used as an alternative to SNMP.
We modified the sentence as below and some figures.

OLD:
such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3413].

NEW:
such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3413] or YANG with Network Configuration Protocol (YANG/NETCONF) [RFC6020].

>For example, Section 3.1.2, page 8, asserts that, based on DOTS telemetry information, "the orchestrator selects an opt>imal DMS". It then gives as an example a very simple selection algorithm which I might describe as selecting an "adequa>te" DMS. Then in the following one-sentence paragraph, it says the selection algorithm is out of scope. How can it be a>sserted that an optimal DMS will be selected without giving any hint as to how to find an algorithm to make such an opt>imal choice? Similar comments would apply to other Sections of this document.

[Yuhei]
In the RFC 9244, some "optimal" word exist.
However, as you concerned, we should be to explain the "optimal" more specifically.
In addition, same things can be said about "Best".

We removed the "optimal" and "best" word from whole the documents except introduction.
We also add some words to explain more specifically.

Section 3.1.2
OLD:
This use case enables transit providers to select an optimal DMS for mitigation based on the volume of the attack traffic and the capacity of a DMS.

NEW:
This use case enables transit providers to select an DMS with sufficient capacity for mitigation based on the volume of the attack traffic and the capacity of a DMS.

Section  3.1.3
OLD:
This use case enables transit providers to select an optimal path for redirecting attack traffic to a DMS according to the bandwidth of the attack traffic and total traffic.

NEW:
This use case enables transit providers to select an path with sufficient bandwidth for redirecting attack traffic to a DMS according to the bandwidth of the attack traffic and total traffic.

We addressed the comment.

[Yuhei]
Oops.
We addressed the commnet.
