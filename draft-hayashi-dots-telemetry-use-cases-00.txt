1.  Introduction

   Denial-of-Service (DDoS), attacks such as volumetric attacks and
   resource-consumption attacks, are critical threats to be handled by
   service providers.  When such DDoS attacks occur, service providers
   have to mitigate them immediately to protect or recover their
   services.

   Therefore, for service providers to immediately protect their network
   services from DDoS attacks, DDoS mitigation needs to be automated.
   To automate DDoS-attack mitigation, multi-vendor components involved
   in DDoS-attack detection and mitigation should cooperate and support
   standard interfaces to communicate.

   DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is a set of protocols for real-time
   signaling, threat-handling requests, and data filtering between the
   multi-vendor elements
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel][I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel].
   Furthermore, DOTS Telemetry enriches the DOTS protocols with various
   telemetry attributes allowing optimal DDoS-attack mitigation
   [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry].  This document presents sample use cases
   for DOTS Telemetry: what components are deployed in the network, how
   they cooperate, and what information is exchanged to effectively use
   attack-mitigation techniques.

Internet-Draft          DOTS Telemetry Use Cases           December 2019


2.  Terminology

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in [RFC8612]

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   Top-talker:  A top N list of attackers who attack the same target or
      targets.  The list is ordered in terms of a two-tuple bandwidth
      such as bps or pps.

   Supervised Machine Learning:  A machine-learning technique that maps
      an input to an output based on example input-output pairs

3.  Use Cases

   This section describes DOTS-Telemetry use cases that use attributes
   included in DOTS Telemetry specifications.

3.1.  DDoS Mitigation Based on Attack Traffic Bandwidth

3.1.1.  Mitigating Attack Flow of Top-talker Preferentially

   Large-scale DDoS attacks, such as amplification attacks, often occur.
   Some transit providers have to mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks
   using DMS with limited resources, which is already deployed in their
   network.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to use their
   DMS efficiently under volume-based DDoS attacks whose bandwidth is
   more than the available capacity of the DMS.  To enable this, attack
   traffic of top talkers is redirected to the DMS preferentially by
   cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow collectors, and
   orchestrators.  Figure 1 gives an overview of this use case.

           * S is for DOTS client functionality

 Figure 1: Mitigating DDoS Attack Flow of Top-talker Preferentially


   In this use case, the forwarding nodes always send statistics of
   traffic flow to the flow collectors by using monitoring functions
   such as NetFlow.  When DDoS attacks occur, the flow collectors detect
   attack traffic and send (src_ip, dst_ip, bandwidth)-tuple information
   of the top talker to the orchestrator using the top-talkers attribute
   of DOTS Telemetry.  The orchestrator then checks the available
   capacity of DMS by using a network management protocol such as
   SNMP[RFC4271].  After that, the orchestrator orders forwarding nodes
   to redirect as much of the top taker's traffic to the DMS as possible
   by dissemination of flow-specification-rule protocols such as BGP
   Flowspec[RFC5575].

   In this case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while the
   orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

3.1.2.  Optimal DMS Selection for Mitigation

   Transit providers, which have a number of DMSs, usually deploy a DMS
   in various forms to satisfy their requirements; individual or
   clustered.  In both forms, they can identify attributes of the DMSs
   such as total capacity, available capacity, and the last hop
   bandwidth.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select an
   optimal DMS for mitigation based on the bandwidth of attack traffic,
   capacity of a DMS, and the last hop bandwidth.  Figure 2 gives an
   overview of this use case.

   orchestrator using the total-attack-traffic attribute of DOTS
   Telemetry.  The orchestrator then checks the available capacity of
   the DMSs by using a network management protocol such as
   SNMP[RFC4271].  After that, the orchestrator chooses optimal DMS
   which each attack traffic should be redirected.  The orchestrator
   then orders forwarding nodes to redirect the attack traffic to the
   optimal DMS by a routing protocol such as BGP[RFC4271].  The
   algorithm of selecting a DMS is out of the scope of this draft.

   In this case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while the
   orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

3.1.3.  Best-path Selection for Redirection

   A transit-provider network, which adopts a mesh network, has multiple
   paths to convey attack traffic to a DMS.  In this network, attack
   traffic can be conveyed while avoiding congested links by selecting
   an available path.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select an
   optimal path for redirecting attack traffic to a DMS according to the
   bandwidth of the attack traffic, total traffic, and total pipe
   capability.  Figure 3 gives an overview of this use case.

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes always send statistics of
   traffic flow to the flow collectors by using monitoring functions
   such as NetFlow.  When DDoS attacks occur, the flow collectors detect
   attack traffic and send (dst_ip, bandwidth)-tuple information to the
   orchestrator using a total-attack-traffic attribute of DOTS
   Telemetry.  On the other hands, forwarding nodes send bandwidth of
   total traffic passing the node and total pipe capability to the
   orchestrator using total-traffic and total-pipe-capability attributes
   of DOTS Telemetry.  The orchestrator then selects an optimal path to
   which each attack-traffic flow should be redirected.  After that, the
   orchestrator orders forwarding nodes to redirect the attack traffic
   to the optimal DMS by dissemination of flow-specification-rules
   protocols such as BGP Flowspec[RFC5575].  The algorithm of selecting
   a path is out of the scope of this draft.

3.1.4.  Short but Extreme Volumetric Attack Mitigation

   Short but extreme volumetric attacks, such as pulse wave DDoS
   attacks, are threats to internet transit provider networks.  It is
   difficult for them to mitigate an attack by DMS by redirecting attack
   flows because it may cause route flapping in the network.  The
   practical way to mitigate short but extreme volumetric attacks is to
   offload a mitigation actions to a forwarding node.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to mitigate
   short but extreme volumetric attacks and estimate the network-access
   success rate based on the bandwidth of attack traffic and total pipe
   capability.  Figure 4 gives an overview of this use case.

Figure 4: Short but Extreme Volumetric Attack Mitigation


   In this use case, when DDoS attacks occur, the network management
   system receives alerts.  It then sends the target ip address, pipe
   capability of the target's link, and bandwidth of the DDoS attack
   traffic to the administrative system using the target, total-pipe-
   capability and total-attack-traffic attributes of DOTS Telemetry.
   After that, the administrative system orders upper forwarding nodes
   to carry out rate-limit all traffic destined to the target based on
   the pipe capability by the dissemination of the flow -specification-

   rules protocols such as BGP Flowspec[RFC5575].  In addition, the
   administrative system estimates the network-access success rate of
   the target, which is calculated by total pipe capability / (total
   pipe capability + total attack traffic).

3.2.  DDoS Mitigation Based on Attack Type

3.2.1.  Selecting Mitigation Technique

   Some volumetric attacks, such as amplification attacks, can be
   detected with high accuracy by checking the layer-3 or layer-4
   information of attack packets.  These attacks can be detected and
   mitigated through cooperation among forwarding nodes and flow
   collectors using NetFlow.  On the other hand, it is necessary to
   inspect the layer-7 information of attack packets to detect attacks
   such as DNS Water Torture Attacks.  Such attack traffic should be
   detected and mitigated at a DMS.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select a
   mitigation technique based on the type of attack traffic:
   amplification attack or not.  To use such a technique, attack traffic
   is blocked at forwarding nodes or redirected to a DMS based on attack
   type through cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow collectors, and
   an orchestrator.  Figure 5 gives an overview of this use case.

Figure 5: DDoS Mitigation Based on Attack Type


   In this use case, the forwarding nodes send statistics of traffic
   flow to the flow collectors by using a monitoring function such as
   NetFlow.  When DDoS attacks occur, the flow collectors detect attack
   traffic and send (dst_ip, src_port, attack_type)-tuple information to
   the orchestrator the using attack-name attribute of DOTS Telemetry.
   The orchestrator then orders forwarding nodes to block the (dst_ip,
   src_port)-tuple flow of amp attack traffic by dissemination of flow-
   specification-rule protocols such as BGP Flowspec[RFC5575].  On the
   other hand, the orchestrator orders forwarding nodes to redirect
   other traffic than the amp attack traffic by a routing protocol such
   as BGP[RFC4271].

   In this case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while the
   orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

3.3.  Training Flow Collector Using Supervised Machine Learning

   DDoS detection based on monitoring functions, such as NetFlow, is a
   lighter weight method of detecting DDoS attacks than DMSs in internet
   transit provider networks.  On the other hand, DDoS detection based
   on the DMSs is a more accurate method of detecting DDoS attacks than
   DDoS detection based on flow monitoring.

   The aim of this use case is to increases flow collector's detection
   accuracy by carrying out supervised machine-learning techniques based
   on the detection results of the DMSs.  To use such a technique,
   forwarding nodes, flow collector, and a DMS should cooperate.
   Figure 5 gives an overview of this use case.

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes always send statistics of
   traffic flow to the flow collectors by using monitoring functions
   such as NetFlow.  When DDoS attacks occur, DDoS orchestration use
   case[I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases] is carried out and the DMS mitigates
   all attack traffic destined for a target.  The DDoS-mitigation system

   reports the (src_ip, dst_ip)-tuple information of the top talker to
   the orchestrator the using top-talkers attribute of DOTS Telemetry.

   After mitigating a DDoS attack, the flow collector attaches teacher
   labels to the statistics of traffic flow based on the reports.  The
   label shows normal traffic or attack name.  The flow collector then
   carries out supervised machine learning to increase its detection
   accuracy, setting the statistics as an explanatory variable and
   setting the labels as an objective variable.

   In this case, the DMS implements a DOTS client while the flow
   collector implements a DOTS server.
