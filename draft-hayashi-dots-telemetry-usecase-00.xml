      <t>
        DOTS Telemetry enriches base DOTS protocol to assist the mitigator to perform efficient DDoS attack mitigation techniques in the network.
        This document presents sample use cases for DOTS telemetry: what componets are deployed in the network, how they collaborate, and what information are exchanged to perform the techniques.
