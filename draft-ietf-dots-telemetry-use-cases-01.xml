      <t>
        Denial-of-Service (DDoS), attacks such as volumetric attacks and resource-consumption attacks, are critical threats to be handled by service providers.
        When such DDoS attacks occur, service providers have to mitigate them immediately to protect or recover their services.
      </t>
      <t>
        Therefore, for service providers to immediately protect their network services from DDoS attacks, DDoS mitigation needs to be automated.
        To automate DDoS-attack mitigation, multi-vendor components involved in DDoS-attack detection and mitigation should cooperate and support standard interfaces to communicate.
      </t>
      <t>
        DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is a set of protocols for real-time signaling, threat-handling requests, and data filtering between the multi-vendor elements <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel" /><xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel" />.
        Furthermore, DOTS Telemetry enriches the DOTS protocols with various telemetry attributes allowing optimal DDoS-attack mitigation <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry" />.
        This document presents sample use cases for DOTS Telemetry: what components are deployed in the network, how they cooperate, and what information is exchanged to effectively use attack-mitigation techniques.

            Large-scale DDoS attacks, such as amplification attacks, often occur. Some transit providers have to mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks using DMS with limited resources, which is already deployed in their network.
          </t>
          <t>
            The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to use their DMS efficiently under volume-based DDoS attacks whose bandwidth is more than the available capacity of the DMS.
            To enable this, attack traffic of top talkers is redirected to the DMS preferentially by cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow collectors, and orchestrators.
            Figure 1 gives an overview of this use case.

            In this use case, the forwarding nodes always send statistics of traffic flow to the flow collectors by using monitoring functions such as IPFIX<xref target="RFC7011" />.
            When DDoS attacks occur, the flow collectors detect attack traffic and send (src_ip, dst_ip, bandwidth)-tuple information of the top talker to the orchestrator using the target-prefix and top-talkers attribute of DOTS Telemetry.
            The orchestrator then checks the available capacity of DMS by using a network management protocol such as SNMP<xref target="RFC3413" />.
            After that, the orchestrator orders forwarding nodes to redirect as much of the top taker's traffic to the DMS as possible by dissemination of flow-specification-rule protocols such as BGP Flowspec<xref target="RFC5575" />.
          </t>
          <t>

            Transit providers, which have a number of DMSs, usually deploy a DMS in various forms to satisfy their requirements; individual or clustered.

            Some volumetric attacks, such as amplification attacks, can be detected with high accuracy by checking the layer-3 or layer-4 information of attack packets.
            These attacks can be detected and mitigated through cooperation among forwarding nodes and flow collectors using IPFIX<xref target="RFC7011" />.
            On the other hand, it is necessary to inspect the layer-7 information of attack packets to detect attacks such as DNS Water Torture Attacks.
            Such attack traffic should be detected and mitigated at a DMS.
          </t>
          <t>
            The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select a mitigation technique based on the type of attack traffic: amplification attack or not.
            To use such a technique, attack traffic is blocked at forwarding nodes or redirected to a DMS based on attack type through cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow collectors, and an orchestrator.
            Figure 5 gives an overview of this use case.

          In this use case, the forwarding nodes send statistics of traffic flow to the flow collectors by using a monitoring function such as IPFIX<xref target="RFC7011" />.
          When DDoS attacks occur, the flow collectors detect attack traffic and send (dst_ip, src_port, attack_type)-tuple information to the orchestrator the using attack-name attribute of DOTS Telemetry.
          The orchestrator then orders forwarding nodes to block the (dst_ip, src_port)-tuple flow of amp attack traffic by dissemination of flow-specification-rule protocols such as BGP Flowspec<xref target="RFC5575" />.
          On the other hand, the orchestrator orders forwarding nodes to redirect other traffic than the amp attack traffic by a routing protocol such as BGP<xref target="RFC4271" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          In this case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while the orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

            DDoS detection based on monitoring functions, such as IPFIX<xref target="RFC7011" />, is a lighter weight method of detecting DDoS attacks than DMSs in internet transit provider networks.
            On the other hand, DDoS detection based on the DMSs is a more accurate method of detecting attack traffic or DDoS attacks bettr than flow monitoring.

            The aim of this use case is to increases flow collector's detection accuracy by carrying out supervised machine-learning techniques according to attack detail reported by the DMSs.

            In this use case, the forwarding nodes always send statistics of traffic flow to the flow collectors by using monitoring functions such as IPFIX<xref target="RFC7011" />.
            When DDoS attacks occur, DDoS orchestration use case<xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"/> is carried out and the DMS mitigates all attack traffic destined for a target.
            The DDoS-mitigation system reports the attack-detail, which includes attack-id and top-talker, to the flow collector using DOTS telemetry.
          </t>
          <t>
            After mitigating a DDoS attack, the flow collector attaches teacher labels, which shows normal traffic or attack type, to the statistics of traffic flow of top-talker based on the reports.
            The flow collector then carries out supervised machine learning to increase its detection accuracy, setting the statistics as an explanatory variable and setting the labels as an objective variable.
          </t>
          <t>
            In this case, the DMS implements a DOTS client while the flow collector implements a DOTS server.
