      <t>DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Telemetry enriches the
      base DOTS protocols to assist the mitigator in using efficient DDoS
      attack mitigation techniques in a network. This document presents sample
      use cases for DOTS Telemetry. It discusses in particular what components
      are deployed in the network, how they cooperate, and what information is
      exchanged to effectively use these techniques.</t>

    <section anchor="section_introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, such as volumetric
      attacks and resource-consumption attacks, are critical threats to be
      handled by service providers. When such DDoS attacks occur, service
      providers have to mitigate them immediately to protect or recover their
      services.</t>

      <t>Therefore, for service providers to immediately protect their network
      services from DDoS attacks, DDoS mitigation needs to be highly
      automated. To that aim, multi-vendor components involved in DDoS attack
      detection and mitigation should cooperate and support standard
      interfaces.</t>

      <t>DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is a set of protocols for real-time
      signaling, threat-handling requests, and data filtering between the
      multi-vendor elements <xref target="RFC9132"></xref><xref
      target="RFC8783"></xref>. DOTS Telemetry enriches the DOTS protocols
      with various telemetry attributes allowing optimal DDoS attack
      mitigation <xref target="RFC9244"></xref>. This document
      presents sample use cases for DOTS Telemetry, which makes concrete
      overview and purpose described in <xref target="RFC9244"></xref>: what components are deployed
      in the network, how they cooperate, and what information is exchanged to
      effectively use attack-mitigation techniques.</t>

      <t>In addition, this document uses the following terms:</t>

      <t>The following subsections assume that once the DOTS signal channel is
        established, DOTS clients proceed with the telemetry setup configuration
        as detailed in Section 7 of <xref target="RFC9244"></xref>.
        In particular, the following telemetry parameters are used: *
        'measurement-interval' to define the period during which percentiles
        are computed. * 'measurement-sample' to define the time distribution for
        measuring values that are used to compute percentiles.</t>

          <t>Some transit providers have to mitigate such large-scale DDoS
          attacks by using DDoS Mitigation Systems (DMSes) with limited
          resources, which is already deployed in their network. For example,
          recent reported large DDoS attacks exceeded 1 Tps.</t>

          <t>The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to use
          their DMS efficiently under volume-based DDoS attacks whose volume
          is more than the available capacity of the DMS. To enable this, the
          attack traffic of top-talkers is redirected to the DMS
          preferentially by cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow
          collectors, and orchestrators. </t>

          <t>Figure 1 gives an overview of this use case. Figure 2 provides an
          example of a DOTS telemetry message body that is used to signal
          top-talkers (2001:db8::2/128 and 2001:db8::3/128).</t>

          <t>The forwarding nodes send traffic statistics to the flow
          collectors using, e.g., IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) <xref target="RFC7011"></xref>.
          When DDoS attacks occur, the flow collectors identifies the attack
          traffic and send information of the top-talkers to the orchestrator
          using the "target-prefix" and "top-talkers" DOTS telemetry
          attributes. The orchestrator, then, checks the available capacity of
          the DMSes by using a network management protocol, such as Simple Network
          Management Protocol (SNMP) <xref target="RFC3413"></xref>.
          After that, the orchestrator orders the
          forwarding nodes to redirect as much of the top-talker's traffic to
          the DMS as possible by dissemination of Flow Specifications relying
          upon tools, such as Border Gateway Protocol  Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules (BGP Flowspec) <xref target="RFC8955"></xref>.</t>

          collectors identify the attack traffic and send information of the

          and "total-attack-traffic" DOTS telemetry attributes. The
          orchestrator, then, checks the available capacity of the DMSes by using
          a network management protocol, such as SNMP. After that, the
          orchestrator selects an optimal DMS to which each attack traffic
          should be redirected. For example, a simple DMS selection algorithm
          is to choose a DMS whose available capacity is greater than the
          "peak-g" atribute indicated in the DOTS telemetry message. The
          orchestrator orders the appropriate forwarding nodes to redirect the
          attack traffic to the optimal DMS relying upon routing policies,
          such as BGP <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>. </t>

          <t>The forwarding nodes send traffic statistics to the flow
          collectors by using, e.g., IPFIX. When DDoS attacks occur, the flow
          collectors identify attack traffic and send information of the
          attack traffic volume to the orchestrator by using a "target-prefix"
          and "total-attack-traffic" DOTS telemetry attributes. On the other
          hands, the underlying forwarding nodes send volume of the total
          traffic passing the node to the orchestrator by using "total-traffic"
          telemetry attributes. The orchestrator then selects an optimal path
          to which each attack-traffic flow should be redirected. For example,
          the simple algorithm of the selection is to choose a path whose
          available capacity is greater than the "peak-g" attribute that was
          indicated in a DOTS telemetry message. After that, the orchestrator
          orders the appropriate forwarding nodes to redirect the attack
          traffic to the optimal DMS by dissemination of Flow Specifications
          relying upon tools, such as BGP Flowspec. </t>

          <t>The detailed path selection algorithm is out of the scope of this
          document.</t>

          <t>Short, but extreme volumetric attacks, such as pulse wave DDoS
          attacks, are threats to internet transit provider networks. The
          feature of the attack is that start from zero and go to maximum
          values in a very short time span, then go back to zero, and back to
          maximum, repeating in continuous cycles at short intervals. It is
          difficult for them to mitigate an attack by DMS by redirecting
          attack flows because it may cause route flapping in the network. The
          practical way to mitigate short but extreme volumetric attacks is to
          offload mitigation actions to a forwarding node.</t>

          <t>The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to
          mitigate short but extreme volumetric attacks. Furthermore, the aim
          is to estimate the network-access success rate based on the
          bandwidth of attack traffic. Figure 7 gives an overview of this use
          case. Figure 8 provides an example of a DOTS telemetry message body
          that is used to signal total pipe capacity. Figure 9 provides an
          example of a DOTS telemetry message body that is used to signal
          various attack traffic percentiles and total traffic
          percentiles.</t>

          <t>When DDoS attacks occur, the network management system receives
          alerts. Then, it sends the target IP address(es) and volume of the
          DDoS attack traffic to the administrative system by using the
          "target-prefix" and "total-attack-traffic" DOTS telemetry
          attributes. After that, the administrative system orders relevant
          forwarding nodes to carry out rate-limit all traffic destined to the
          target based on the pipe capability by the dissemination of the Flow
          Specifications relying upon tools, such as BGP Flowspec. In
          addition, the administrative system estimates the network-access
          success rate of the target, which is calculated by
          (total-pipe-capability / (total-pipe-capability +
          total-attack-traffic)). </t>

          <t>Note that total pipe capability information can be gatherd by
          telemetry setup in advance (Section 7.2 of <xref
          target="RFC9244"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The network management system implements a DOTS client
          while the administrative system implements a DOTS server.</t>

                 title="Selecting Mitigation Technique Based on Attack Type">
          <t>Some volumetric attacks, such as amplification attacks, can be
          detected with high accuracy by checking the Layer 3 or Layer 4
          information of attack packets. These attacks can be detected and
          mitigated through cooperation among forwarding nodes and flow
          collectors by using IPFIX. It may also be necessary to inspect the Layer 7
          information of suspecious packets to detect attacks such as DNS
          Water Torture Attacks. Such an attack traffic should be detected and
          mitigated at a DMS.</t>

          <t>The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select
          a mitigation technique based on the type of attack traffic:
          amplification attack or not. To use such a technique, the attack
          traffic is blocked by forwarding nodes or redirected to a DMS based
          on the attack type through cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow
          collectors, and an orchestrator. </t>

          <t>Figure 10 gives an overview of this use case. Figure 11 provides
          an example of attack mappings as below are shared by using the DOTS
          data channel in advance. Figure 12 provides an example of a DOTS
          telemetry message body that is used to signal various attack traffic
          percentiles, total traffic percentiles, total attack connection and
          attack type.</t>

        <t>The network management system in the enterprise network reports
        limits of incoming traffic volume from the transit provider to the
        orchestrator in the transit provider in advance. It is reported by
        using "total-pipe-capacity" telemetry attribute in DOTS telemetry
        setup.</t>

        <t>When DDoS attacks occur, DDoS mitugation orchestration <xref
        target="RFC8903"></xref> is carried out in the transit provider. Then,
        the DDoS mitigation systems reports the status of DDoS countermeasures
        to the orchestrator by sending "attack-detail" telemetry attributes.
        After that, the orchestrator integrates the reports from the DDoS
        mitigation system, while removing duplicate contents, and sends them to a
        network administrator by using DOTS telemetry periodically.</t>

        <t>During the DDoS mitigation, the orchestrator in the transit
        provider retrieves link congestion status from the network manager in
        the enterprise network by using "total-traffic" telemetry attributes.
        Then, the orchestrator checks whether the DDoS countermeasures are
        effective or not by comparing the "total-traffic" and the
        "total-pipe-capacity" attributes.</t>

        <t>The DMS implements a DOTS server while the orchestrator behaves as
        a DOTS client and a server in the transit provider. In addition, the
        network administrator implements a DOTS client.</t>

          <t>DDoS detection based on tools, such as IPFIX, is a lighter weight
          method of detecting DDoS attacks than DMSes in internet transit
          provider networks. On the other hand, DDoS detection based on the
          DMSes is a more accurate method for detecting attack traffic
          than flow monitoring.</t>
          <t>The aim of this use case is to increase flow collector's detection
          accuracy by carrying out supervised machine-learning
          techniques according to attack detail reported by the DMSes. To use
          such a technique, forwarding nodes, flow collector, and a DMS should
          cooperate. Figure 16 gives an overview of this use case. Figure 17
          provides an example of a DOTS telemetry message body that is used to
          signal various total attack traffic percentiles and attack

          <t>The forwarding nodes send traffic statistics to the flow
          collectors by using, e.g., IPFIX. When DDoS attacks occur, DDoS
          mitigation orchestration is carried out (as per Section 3.3 of <xref
          target="RFC8903"></xref>) and the DMS mitigates all attack traffic
          destined for a target. The DDoS mitigation system reports the
          "vendor-id", "attack-id", and "top-talker" telemetry attributes to a
          flow collector.</t>

          <t>After mitigating a DDoS attack, the flow collector attaches
          outputs of the DMS as labels to the statistics of traffic flow of top-talkers.
          The outputs, for example, are the "attack-id" telemetry attributes.
          The flow collector, then, carries out supervised machine learning to
          increase its detection accuracy, setting the statistics as an
          explanatory variable and setting the labels as an objective
          variable.</t>

          <t>The DMS implements a DOTS client while the flow collector
          implements a DOTS server.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>DOTS telemetry security considerations are discussed in Section 14 of
      <xref target="RFC9244"></xref>. These considerations
      apply for the communication interfaces where DOTS is used. </t>

      <t>Some use cases involve controllers, orchestrators, and programmable
      interfaces. These interfaces can be misused by misbehaving nodes to
      further exacerbate DDoS attacks. Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC7149"></xref> discusses some generic security considerations
      to take into account in such contexts (e.g., reliable access control).
      Specific security measures depend on the actual mechanism used to
      control underlying forwarding nodes and other controlled elements. For
      example, Section 13 of <xref target="RFC8955"></xref> discusses security
      considerations that are relevant to BGP Flowspec.
      IPFIX-specific considerations are discussed in Section 11 of <xref
